\chapter{Alternate Entry Points to \textsc{Patus}}

As the auto-tuner module is decoupled from the code generating system, it can be used as a stand-alone auto-tuner
for other codes besides the ones created by \textsc{Patus}.
If the user has a hand-crafted existing parametrized code for which the best configurations need to be determined,
the \textsc{Patus} auto-tuner is a perfectly valid option to find the best set of parameters.
The only requirements are that the tunable parameters must be exposed as command line parameters
and that the program must print the timing information to \texttt{stdout} as last line of the program output in an arbitrary
time measurement unit.
Note that the auto-tuner tries to {\em minimize} this number, i.e., it must be a time measurement rather than a performance number.
