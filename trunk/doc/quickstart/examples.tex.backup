\section{Examples}

In the \texttt{example} directory some example stencil specifications can be found.

The \texttt{stencil} subdirectory contains single stencil specifications, for which
code can be generated using the provided Makefile. The Makefile builds the benchmarking
harnesses at the same time.

In the \texttt{applications} two example applications can be found, which use
\textsc{Patus} to generate the computate kernels.
For both applications, Makefiles are provided. Typing \cmd{make} in the shell will
build and run the simulations.
