  abstract = {Current programming models and compiler tech-
	
	nologies for multi-core processors do not exploit well the per-
	
	formance benefits obtainable by applying algorithm-specific, i.e.,
	
	semantic-specific optimizations to a particular application. In this
	
	work, we propose a pattern-making methodology that allows
	
	algorithm-specific optimizations to be encapsulated into “opti-
	
	mization patterns” that are expressed in terms of pre-processor
	
	directives so that simple annotations can result in significant
	
	performance improvements. To validate this new methodology, a
	
	framework, named EPOD, is developed to map such directives
	
	to the underlying optimization schemes.
	
	We have identified and implemented a number of opti-
	
	mization patterns for three representative computer platforms.
	
	Our experimental results show that a pattern-guided compiler
	
	can outperform the state-of-the-art compilers and even achieve
	
	performance as competitive as hand-tuned code. Thus, such a
	
	pattern-making methodology represents an encouraging direction
	
	for domain experts’ experience and knowledge to be integrated
	
	into general-purpose compilers.},

	body human models of an adult male (34 years old), an adult female
	(26 years old) and two children (an 11-year-old girl and a six-year-old
	boy) for the optimized evaluation of electromagnetic exposure. These
	four models are referred to as the Virtual Family. They are based
	on high resolution magnetic resonance (MR) images of healthy volunteers.
	More than 80 different tissue types were distinguished during the
	segmentation. To improve the accuracy and the effectiveness of the
	segmentation, a novel semi-automated tool was used to analyze and
	segment the data. All tissues and organs were reconstructed as three-dimensional
	(3D) unstructured triangulated surface objects, yielding high precision
	images of individual features of the body. This greatly enhances
	the meshing flexibility and the accuracy with respect to thin tissue
	layers and small organs in comparison with the traditional voxel-based
	representation of anatomical models. Conformal computational techniques
	were also applied. The techniques and tools developed in this study
	can be used to more effectively develop future models and further
	improve the accuracy of the models for various applications. For
	research purposes, the four models are provided for free to the scientific
	community.},

  journal = {J. Geophys. Res.},

  volume = {112},
  number = {B02302},
  abstract = {We adapt the traction‐at‐split‐node method for spontaneous rupture
	simulations to the velocity‐stress staggered‐grid finite difference
	scheme. The staggered‐grid implementation introduces both velocity
	and stress discontinuities via split nodes. The staggered traction
	components on the fault plane are interpolated to form the traction
	vector at split nodes, facilitating alignment of the vectors of sliding
	friction and slip velocity. To simplify the split‐node partitioning
	of the equations of motion, spatial differencing is reduced from
	fourth to second order along the fault plane, but in the remainder
	of the grid the spatial differencing scheme remains identical to
	conventional spatially fourth‐order three‐dimensional staggered‐grid
	schemes. The resulting staggered‐grid split node (SGSN) method has
	convergence rates relative to rupture‐time, final‐slip, and peak‐slip‐velocity
	metrics that are very similar to the corresponding rates for both
	a partly staggered split‐node code (DFM) and the boundary integral
	method. The SGSN method gives very accurate solutions (in the sense
	that errors are comparable to the uncertainties in the reference
	solution) when the median resolution of the cohesive zone is 4.4
	grid points. Combined with previous results for other grid types
	and other fault‐discontinuity approximations, the SGSN results demonstrate
	that accuracy in finite difference solutions to the spontaneous rupture
	problem is controlled principally by the scheme used to represent
	the fault discontinuity, and is relatively insensitive to the grid
	geometry used to represent the continuum. The method provides an
	efficient and accurate means of adding spontaneous rupture capability
	to velocity‐stress staggered‐grid finite difference codes, while
	retaining the computational advantages of those codes for problems
	of wave propagation in complex media.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe transformation recipes, which provide a
	high-level interface to the code transformation and code generation
	capability of a compiler. These recipes can be generated by compiler
	decision algorithms or savvy software developers. This interface
	is part of an auto-tuning framework that explores a set of different
	implementations of the same computation and automatically selects
	the best-performing implementation. Along with the original computation,
	a transformation recipe specifies a range of implementations of the
	computation resulting from composing a set of high-level code transformations.
	In our system, an underlying polyhedral framework coupled with transformation
	algorithms takes this set of transformations, composes them and automatically
	generates correct code. We first describe an abstract interface for
	transformation recipes, which we propose to facilitate interoperability
	with other transformation frameworks. We then focus on the specific
	transformation recipe interface used in our compiler and present
	performance results on its application to kernel and library tuning
	and tuning of key computations in high-end applications. We also
	show how this framework can be used to generate and auto-tune parallel
	OpenMP or CUDA code from a high-level specification.},

	years has uncovered about these algorithms. In particular, while
	the original direct search methods were consciously based on straightforward
	heuristics, more recent analysis has shown that in most -- but not

  abstract = {Iterative stencil loops (ISLs) are used in many applications and tiling
	is a well-known technique to localize their computation. When ISLs
	are tiled across a parallel architecture, there are usually halo
	regions that need to be updated and exchanged among different processing
	elements (PEs). In addition, synchronization is often used to signal
	the completion of halo exchanges. Both communication and synchronization
	may incur significant overhead on parallel architectures with shared
	memory. This is especially true in the case of graphics processors
	(GPUs), which do not preserve the state of the per-core L1 storage
	across global synchronizations. To reduce these overheads, ghost
	zones can be created to replicate stencil operations, reducing communication
	and synchronization costs at the expense of redundantly computing
	some values on multiple PEs. However, the selection of the optimal
	ghost zone size depends on the characteristics of both the architecture
	and the application, and it has only been studied for message-passing
	systems in distributed environments. To automate this process on
	shared memory systems, we establish a performance model using NVIDIA’s
	Tesla architecture as a case study and propose a framework that uses
	the performance model to automatically select the ghost zone size
	that performs best and generate appropriate code. The modeling is
	validated by four diverse ISL applications, for which the predicted
	ghost zone configurations are able to achieve a speedup no less than
	95% of the optimal speedup.},

	an analytical solution, and an error analysis is performed to understand
	its behavior. The new scheme behaves considerably better than the
	standard scheme. Furthermore, in contrast to the standard scheme,
	it is possible to obtain with it more accurate solutions by increasing

  title = {{Auto-tuning Performance on Multicore Computers}},
  school = {EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley},
  year = {2008},
  month = {Dec},
  abstract = {For the last decade, the exponential potential of Moore's Law has
	been squandered in the effort to increase single thread performance,
	which is now limited by the memory, instruction, and power walls.
	In response, the computing industry has boldly placed its hopes on
	the multicore gambit. That is, abandon instruction-level parallelism
	and frequency-scaling in favor of the exponential scaling of the
	number of compute cores per microprocessor. The massive thread-level
	parallelism results in tremendous potential performance, but demands
	efficient parallel programming - a task existing software tools are
	ill-equipped for. We desire performance portability - the ability
	to write a program once and not only have it deliver good performance
	on the development computer, but on all multicore computers today
	and tomorrow. This thesis accepts for fact that multicore is the
	basis for all future computers. Furthermore, we regiment our study
	by organizing it around the computational patterns and motifs as
	set forth in the Berkeley View. Although domain experts may be extremely
	knowledgeable on the mathematics and algorithms of their fields,
	they often lack the detailed computer architecture knowledge required
	to achieve high performance. Forthcoming heterogeneous architectures
	will exacerbate the problem for everyone. Thus, we extend the auto-tuning
	approach to program optimization and performance portability to the
	menagerie of multicore computers. In an automated fashion, an auto-tuner
	will explore the optimization space for a particular computational
	kernel of a motif on a particular computer. In doing so, it will
	determine the best combination of algorithm, implementation, and
	data structure for the combination of architecture and input data.
	
	We implement and evaluate auto-tuners for two important kernels: Lattice
	Boltzmann Magnetohydrodynamics (LBMHD) and sparse matrix-vector multiplication
	(SpMV). They are representative of two of the computational motifs:
	structured grids and sparse linear algebra. To demonstrate the performance
	portability that our auto-tuners deliver, we selected an extremely
	wide range of architectures as an experimental test bed. These include
	conventional dual- and quad-core superscalar x86 processors both
	with and without integrated memory controllers. We also include the
	rather unconventional chip multithreaded (CMT) Sun Niagara2 (Victoria
	Falls) and the heterogeneous, local store-based IBM Cell Broadband
	Engine. In some experiments we sacrifice the performance portability
	of a common C representation, by creating ISA-specific auto-tuned
	versions of these kernels to gain architectural insight. To quantify
	our success, we created the Roofline model to perform a bound and
	bottleneck analysis for each kernel-architecture combination.
	
	Despite the common wisdom that LBMHD and SpMV are memory bandwidth-bound,
	and thus nothing can be done to improve performance, we show that
	auto-tuning consistently delivers speedups in excess of 3x across
	all multicore computers except the memory-bound Intel Clovertown,
	where the benefit was as little as 1.5x. The Cell processor, with
	its explicitly managed memory hierarchy, showed far more dramatic
	speedups of between 20x and 130x. The auto-tuners includes both architecture-independent
	optimizations based solely on source code transformations and high-level
	kernel knowledge, as well as architecture-specific optimizations
	like the explicit use of single instruction, multiple data (SIMD)
	extensions or the use Cell's DMA-based memory operations. We observe
	that the these ISA-specific optimizations are becoming increasingly
	important as architectures evolve.},

@book{Kennedy02,
    abstract = {Modern computer architectures designed with high-performance microprocessors offer tremendous potential gains in performance over previous designs. Yet their very complexity makes it increasingly difficult to produce efficient code and to realize their full potential. This landmark text from two leaders in the field focuses on the pivotal role that compilers can play in addressing this critical issue. The basis for all the methods presented in this book is data dependence, a fundamental compiler analysis tool for optimizing programs on high-performance microprocessors and parallel architectures. It enables compiler designers to write compilers that automatically transform simple, sequential programs into forms that can exploit special features of these modern architectures. The text provides a broad introduction to data dependence, to the many transformation strategies it supports, and to its applications to important optimization problems such as parallelization, compiler memory hierarchy management, and instruction scheduling. The authors demonstrate the importance and wide applicability of dependence-based compiler optimizations and give the compiler writer the basics needed to understand and implement them. They also offer cookbook explanations for transforming applications by hand to computational scientists and engineers who are driven to obtain the best possible performance of their complex applications.},

    abstract = {The computer industry has a problem. As Moore's law marches on, it will be exploited to double cores, not frequencies. But all those cores, growing to 8, 16 and beyond over the next several years, are of little value without parallel software. Where will this come from? With few exceptions, only graduate students and other strange people write parallel software. Even for numerically intensive applications, where parallel algorithms are well understood, professional software engineers almost never write parallel software. Somehow we need to (1) design many core systems programmers can actually use and (2) provide programmers with parallel programming environments that work. The good news is we have 25+ years of history in the {HPC} space to guide us. The bad news is that few people are paying attention to this experience. This talk looks at the history of parallel computing to develop a set of anecdotal rules to follow as we create many core systems and their programming environments. A common theme is that just about every mistake we could make has already been made by someone. So rather than reinvent these mistakes, let's learn from the past and "do it right this time".},

    Abstract = {For decades, computer scientists have sought guidance on how to evolve architectures, languages, and programming models in order to improve application performance, efficiency, and productivity. Unfortunately, without overarching advice about future directions in these areas, individual guidance is inferred from the existing software/hardware ecosystem, and each discipline often conducts their research independently assuming all other technologies remain fixed. In today's rapidly evolving world of on-chip parallelism, isolated and iterative improvements to performance may miss superior solutions in the same way gradient descent optimization techniques may get stuck in local minima. To combat this, we present TORCH: A Testbed for Optimization ResearCH. These computational reference kernels define the core problems of interest in scientific computing without mandating a specific language, algorithm, programming model, or implementation. To compliment the kernel (problem) definitions, we provide a set of algorithmically-expressed verification tests that can be used to verify a hardware/software co-designed solution produces an acceptable answer. Finally, to provide some illumination as to how researchers have implemented solutions to these problems in the past, we provide a set of reference implementations in C and MATLAB.}

The Cenju-4 is a parallel computer which support hardware distributed shared memory (DSM) system. The shared address space is explicitly allocated at the initialization phase of the program. The Omni converts all global variable declarations into indirect references through the pointers, and generates code to allocate those variables in the shared address space at runtime. The OpenMP programs can execute on a distributed memory machine with hardware DSM by using the Omni. The preliminary results using benchmark programs show that the performance of OpenMP programs didnt scales. While its performance of OpenMP benchmark programs scales poorly, it enables users to execute the same program on both a shared memory machine and a distribute memory machine.},

    abstract = {The emergence and continuing use of multi-core architectures and graphics processing units require changes in the existing software and sometimes even a redesign of the established algorithms in order to take advantage of now prevailing parallelism. Parallel Linear Algebra for Scalable Multi-core Architectures ({PLASMA}) and Matrix Algebra on {GPU} and Multics Architectures ({MAGMA}) are two projects that aims to achieve high performance and portability across a wide range of multi-core architectures and hybrid systems respectively. We present in this document a comparative study of {PLASMA}'s performance against established linear algebra packages and some preliminary results of {MAGMA} on hybrid multi-core and {GPU} systems.},
