/**
 * Very similar to a LinkedList, except provides an <var>add</var>
 * method that returns the list itself, allowing you to
 * perform method chaining.  A beneficial side
 * effect is that you can add multiple elements directly
 * to a list created with the new operator, without
 * first creating a new variable to hold a reference to
 * the list object.  ChainedLists can be used anywhere
 * a LinkedList or List occurs, and are entirely optional.
 * It is possible to write passes for Cetus without using this class,
 * however you will find that your code contains a lot of temporary
 * lists created for the sole purpose of passing them as method arguments.
